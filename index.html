          Úll is a conference for people who build and love great products. We focus on great product stories, presented through an Apple-shaped lens. We treat the conference itself as a product: with a deep emphasis on the attendee experience.

        <p>
          This year we explore the theme of <em>the future</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The future we dreamed of as kids is here. We don’t have flying cars, but we do have touchscreen phones, cars that drive themselves, automated homes and instant access anywhere to a centralized body of all the world’s knowledge. This year we’ll ask, ‘where do we go from here?’ as we listen to stories and predictions, discuss what’s possible and question whether ‘can do’ means ‘should do’ and, delve deeper through a series of interactive features and installations.
        </p>

        <p>
          As always, the focus will be on building strong relationships and bringing a fresh outlook to our lives and our work.
        </p>

        <p>
          We hope you can be part of it.
        </p>

          For the third, and final time, Úll returns in 2017 to The Europe in Killarney. The Europe has become a special place for Úll, not least because we have found a group of talented like-minded partners in the team there. This is a multi-award winning hotel and resort with stunning views overlooking Lough Leane. Situated in Killarney, in the kingdom of Kerry, in Ireland’s south west coast (which you may be familiar with from a certain recent Star Wars film). It’s the perfect place to reflect on the bigger picture, steeped in natural beauty.
