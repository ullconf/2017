        <h3 class="left">Fringe events</h3>

        <p>
          We also organise an unofficial “official” pre-conference event and a wind-down event. These are completely optional and ticketed separately. We organise these fringe events so that you have extra time to spend with speakers and friends old and new.
          Both events are ticketed separately to the main conference. The pre-conference event (Speaker’s Dinner) is €149 and the Wind-Down is €79. These fees mainly cover the organising costs.
        </p>

        <h3 class="left">All-inclusive options</h3>

        <p>
          As we have exclusive-use of the hotel, only Úll attendees can stay in the hotel for the 2 conference nights. Rooms are exclusively available through us for those two nights.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can accommodate double rooms, single rooms and twin rooms for those who wish to share. If you opt for a shared room, you can opt for someone to share with, or we will match you with someone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Accommodation in the Europe is €200 per night, so conference plus accommodation is €999 in a private room, €849 in a shared room.
        </p>

        <p>
          Accommodation for the fringe events should be booked separately. Since the events are taking place in Dublin City Centre, there are plenty of options for accommodation. However, we do have some rooms on hold at Hotel A and Hotel B which have a special price for Úll attendees. If you would like to avail of the offers, simply call the hotel and mention Úll when booking. Please note, they can only hold rooms at this price until 8 March 2017.
